Rank Scores
https://leetcode.com/problems/rank-scores/
Write a SQL query to rank scores. If there is a tie between two scores, both should have the same ranking. Note that after a tie, the next ranking number should be the next consecutive integer value. In other words, there should be no "holes" between ranks.

+----+-------+
| Id | Score |
+----+-------+
| 1  | 3.50  |
| 2  | 3.65  |
| 3  | 4.00  |
| 4  | 3.85  |
| 5  | 4.00  |
| 6  | 3.65  |
+----+-------+
For example, given the above Scores table, your query should generate the following report (order by highest score):

+-------+------+
| Score | Rank |
+-------+------+
| 4.00  | 1    |
| 4.00  | 1    |
| 3.85  | 2    |
| 3.65  | 3    |
| 3.65  | 3    |
| 3.50  | 4    |
+-------+------+
SELECT s.Score, count(distinct t.score) Rank
FROM Scores s JOIN Scores t ON s.Score <= t.score
GROUP BY s.Id
ORDER BY s.Score desc

-- SELECT
--   Score,
--   (SELECT count(*) FROM (SELECT distinct Score s FROM Scores) tmp WHERE s >= Score) Rank
-- FROM Scores
-- ORDER BY Score desc

-- SELECT
--   Score,
--   (SELECT count(distinct Score) FROM Scores WHERE Score >= s.Score) Rank
-- FROM Scores s
-- ORDER BY Score desc

Rising Temperature
https://leetcode.com/problems/rising-temperature/

Given a Weather table, write a SQL query to find all dates' Ids with higher temperature compared to its previous (yesterday's) dates.

+---------+------------+------------------+
| Id(INT) | Date(DATE) | Temperature(INT) |
+---------+------------+------------------+
|       1 | 2015-01-01 |               10 |
|       2 | 2015-01-02 |               25 |
|       3 | 2015-01-03 |               20 |
|       4 | 2015-01-04 |               30 |
+---------+------------+------------------+
For example, return the following Ids for the above Weather table:
+----+
| Id |
+----+
|  2 |
|  4 |
+----+
"""
select w1.Id as Id
from Weather w1, Weather w2
where w1.Temperature > w2.Temperature
    and TO_DAYS(w1.Date) - 1 = TO_DAYS(w2.Date);

Trips and Users
The Trips table holds all taxi trips. Each trip has a unique Id, while Client_Id and Driver_Id are both foreign keys to the Users_Id at the Users table. Status is an ENUM type of ('completed', 'cancelled_by_driver', 'cancelled_by_client').

+----+-----------+-----------+---------+--------------------+----------+
| Id | Client_Id | Driver_Id | City_Id |        Status      |Request_at|
+----+-----------+-----------+---------+--------------------+----------+
| 1  |     1     |    10     |    1    |     completed      |2013-10-01|
| 2  |     2     |    11     |    1    | cancelled_by_driver|2013-10-01|
| 3  |     3     |    12     |    6    |     completed      |2013-10-01|
| 4  |     4     |    13     |    6    | cancelled_by_client|2013-10-01|
| 5  |     1     |    10     |    1    |     completed      |2013-10-02|
| 6  |     2     |    11     |    6    |     completed      |2013-10-02|
| 7  |     3     |    12     |    6    |     completed      |2013-10-02|
| 8  |     2     |    12     |    12   |     completed      |2013-10-03|
| 9  |     3     |    10     |    12   |     completed      |2013-10-03|
| 10 |     4     |    13     |    12   | cancelled_by_driver|2013-10-03|
+----+-----------+-----------+---------+--------------------+----------+
The Users table holds all users. Each user has an unique Users_Id, and Role is an ENUM type of ('client', 'driver', 'partner').

+----------+--------+--------+
| Users_Id | Banned |  Role  |
+----------+--------+--------+
|    1     |   No   | client |
|    2     |   Yes  | client |
|    3     |   No   | client |
|    4     |   No   | client |
|    10    |   No   | driver |
|    11    |   No   | driver |
|    12    |   No   | driver |
|    13    |   No   | driver |

Write a SQL query to find the cancellation rate of requests made by unbanned clients between Oct 1, 2013 and Oct 3, 2013. For the above tables, your SQL query should return the following rows with the cancellation rate being rounded to two decimal places.

+------------+-------------------+
|     Day    | Cancellation Rate |
+------------+-------------------+
| 2013-10-01 |       0.33        |
| 2013-10-02 |       0.00        |
| 2013-10-03 |       0.50        |
+------------+-------------------+
